# Senior-Project_Fuzzy-Logic-Medieval-Chess
### Synopsis of project 
This project was written in Java utilizing the JavaFx API to create a Fuzzy-Logic-Medieval-Chess Game which could be played against another player or against an AI. The AI was to be distrubuted among the AI's pieces. Each piece on the AI team would consist in part of an AI which would determine the best moves for that piece and then send a sorted list of possible moves to a commanding piece which would decide which move that piece would make.
